    The new Groups API

    ### Pagination
      Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can specify
      further pages with the `page` parameter. You can also set a custom page
      size up to 100 with the `perPage` parameter.

      Pagination response data is included in http headers. By Default, the response header contains links with `next`, `last`, `first`, `prev` resource links.
